## Quick Workflow Reference

### Priority Decision Matrix
```
Critical Path Impact vs Effort:

Low Impact, High Effort â†’ DON'T DO (P3)
```

```
SIMPLE (1-4 hours):
- Bug fixes
- Small UI changes
- Configuration updates
- Documentation updates

MODERATE (4-8 hours):
- New API endpoints
- Database migrations
- Feature components
- Test automation

COMPLEX (8-16 hours):
- New features
- Architecture changes
- Integration work
- Performance optimization

EPIC (16+ hours):
- Major features
- System redesigns
- Large integrations
- Infrastructure overhauls
```

### Status Transition Rules
```
PENDING â†’ IN_PROGRESS: When work begins
IN_PROGRESS â†’ BLOCKED: When dependency blocks progress
BLOCKED â†’ IN_PROGRESS: When blocker is resolved
IN_PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED: When all acceptance criteria met
COMPLETED â†’ IN_PROGRESS: If issues found in testing
