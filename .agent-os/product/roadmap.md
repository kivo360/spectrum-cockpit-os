## Dependencies and Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path Dependencies

2. **Phase 2 → Phase 4:** Task graph structure required for visualization
3. **Phase 1-3 → Phase 5:** Data architecture must support all features

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Technical Risks:** Prototype complex features early, maintain fallback options
- **Performance Risks:** Implement benchmarking from Phase 1, optimize continuously  
- **Integration Risks:** Start MCP client testing in Phase 1, maintain compatibility matrix
- **Resource Risks:** Prioritize must-have features, defer should-have features if needed
