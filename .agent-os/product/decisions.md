## 2025-07-31: Architecture Framework Selection

**ID:** DEC-002  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Senior Developers  

### Decision

Use FastMCP framework with Python 3.12+ as core architecture, maintaining compatibility with existing codebase while enabling sophisticated agent coordination and real-time web interfaces.

### Context

Need to balance rapid development with advanced features. FastMCP provides MCP protocol integration while allowing incremental migration from current system. Python ecosystem offers robust libraries for graph algorithms, web frameworks, and async processing.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js/TypeScript Full Rewrite**
   - Pros: mcp-shrimp uses TypeScript, unified language stack, excellent web performance
   - Cons: Complete rewrite required, team Python expertise, loss of current codebase

2. **Rust for Performance**
   - Pros: Maximum performance, memory safety, excellent concurrency
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, slower development, limited team expertise

### Rationale

FastMCP framework enables rapid development while providing sophisticated MCP integration. Python's rich ecosystem supports graph algorithms (NetworkX), web frameworks (FastAPI), and async processing (asyncio). Existing codebase provides foundation for incremental enhancement rather than complete rewrite.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development timeline leveraging existing codebase
- Python ecosystem provides robust libraries for all required functionality
- Team expertise maximizes development velocity
- FastMCP framework handles MCP protocol complexity

**Negative:**
- Performance may be lower than compiled languages for extreme scale
- More complex than simple enhancement approach
- Requires learning FastMCP framework patterns

## 2025-07-31: Agent Coordination Model

**ID:** DEC-003  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Product  
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead, Tech Lead  

### Decision

Implement distinct TaskPlanner and TaskExecutor agent modes with role-based permissions enforced through tool access control rather than complex authentication systems.

### Context

Analysis of mcp-shrimp-task-manager reveals sophisticated agent coordination patterns. Need to balance complexity with usability while providing clear role separation that prevents common coordination errors.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Agent Mode with Guidelines**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer constraints, faster development
   - Cons: Role confusion, quality inconsistency, coordination errors

2. **Complex Permission System with User Management**
   - Pros: Fine-grained control, enterprise-ready, audit trails
   - Cons: Over-engineered for target users, complexity barrier, maintenance overhead

### Rationale

Tool-based permission system provides clear role separation without complex authentication. TaskPlanner focus on analysis prevents code execution errors. TaskExecutor specialization improves implementation quality. Pattern proven in mcp-shrimp-task-manager analysis.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear role boundaries prevent common coordination errors
- Specialized agent modes improve output quality
- Simple permission model reduces complexity
- Scalable to multiple agent instances

**Negative:**
- More complex than single-mode system
- Requires user understanding of role distinctions
- Tool access control must be comprehensive

## 2025-07-31: Task Architecture Complexity

**ID:** DEC-004  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner  

### Decision

Implement sophisticated task schema with 15+ fields including dependencies, related files with line-level precision, implementation guides, and verification criteria, using graph-based dependency resolution.

### Context

Current 8-field task schema insufficient for complex projects. mcp-shrimp-task-manager demonstrates value of rich task metadata, file associations, and dependency graphs. Users need structure for quality and coordination.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Task Lists with Minimal Metadata**
   - Pros: Easy to understand, fast implementation, low complexity
   - Cons: Inadequate for complex projects, manual coordination required, error-prone

2. **Enterprise-Level Task Management**
   - Pros: Comprehensive features, mature patterns, extensive metadata
   - Cons: Over-engineered for target users, slow performance, complexity barrier

### Rationale

Complex projects require sophisticated task architecture. File associations with line-level precision enable precise coordination. Dependency graphs prevent execution order errors. Rich metadata improves quality and enables automation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Supports complex project coordination requirements
- File associations enable precise development coordination
- Dependency graphs prevent execution order errors
- Rich metadata enables quality automation

**Negative:**
- Higher complexity for simple use cases
- More data entry required from users
- Graph algorithms add technical complexity
- Potential performance implications for large projects

## 2025-07-31: Web Interface Strategy

**ID:** DEC-005  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** UX Lead, Frontend Developer, Tech Lead  

### Decision

Implement dual web interface approach: embedded WebGUI using D3.js for dependency visualization and standalone React application for advanced task management.

### Context

Users need visual project management for complex dependency relationships. mcp-shrimp-task-manager demonstrates value of both embedded and standalone interfaces. Different use cases require different interface approaches.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Embedded Interface Only**
   - Pros: Simpler development, unified user experience, lower maintenance
   - Cons: Limited functionality, poor mobile experience, scaling constraints

2. **Single Standalone Application Only**
   - Pros: Full functionality, modern UI patterns, excellent performance
   - Cons: Separate deployment, integration complexity, embedded use cases unsupported

### Rationale

Embedded interface supports quick visualization needs. Standalone React application provides advanced functionality. D3.js optimal for dependency graph visualization. Dual approach maximizes use case coverage while maintaining development efficiency.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Comprehensive coverage of user interface needs
- D3.js provides optimal dependency graph visualization
- React application enables advanced functionality
- Flexibility for different deployment scenarios

**Negative:**
- Higher development complexity with two interfaces
- Maintenance overhead for multiple codebases
- Potential user confusion about which interface to use
- Integration complexity between interfaces

## 2025-07-31: Real-Time Update Mechanism

**ID:** DEC-006  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical  
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Frontend Developer  

### Decision

Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time task status updates with automatic reconnection and fallback to polling for critical functionality.

### Context

Real-time updates essential for multi-agent coordination. Users need immediate visibility into task status changes, dependency resolution, and project progress. WebSocket alternatives considered but SSE simpler for one-way updates.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **WebSocket Bidirectional Communication**
   - Pros: Full bidirectional communication, lower latency, standard protocol
   - Cons: More complex implementation, connection management overhead, overkill for primarily one-way updates

2. **Polling-Based Updates**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, robust fallback, works universally
   - Cons: Higher server load, poor user experience, inefficient resource usage

### Rationale

SSE optimal for one-way real-time updates with automatic reconnection. Simpler than WebSocket for primarily server-to-client communication. Good browser support and fallback options available.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Real-time user experience for task status updates
- Simpler implementation than bidirectional protocols
- Automatic reconnection handles network issues
- Good browser compatibility

**Negative:**
- One-way communication limits some interaction patterns
- Server connection overhead for many concurrent users
- Fallback complexity for environments blocking SSE
- Debugging complexity for real-time issues
